# Brain MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Scan classification for tumor 

##### This project belongs to the field of computer vision. It tries to use deep learning techniques to classify the images of MRI scan of the human brain as infected with tumor or not. It takes an image of the MRI scan as the input and produces the output.

### Dataset
MRI images dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

### Libraries used
1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib

##### The model is able to achieve an accuracy of more than 90%. The model is saved and available for download
